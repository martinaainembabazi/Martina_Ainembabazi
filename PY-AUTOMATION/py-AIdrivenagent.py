# Post Automation Agent
# Example: Create an AI-driven agent that automates tasks of creating posts on X.com (formerly Twitter) using Python.
# for a period of 30 days, with a focus on automating the process of posting content, engaging with followers, and
# analyzing post performance.

# How it will work:
# 1. **Content Creation**: The agent will generate content ideas based on trending topics and user interests.
# 2. **Post Scheduling**: It will schedule posts at optimal times for maximum engagement.
# 3. **Engagement**: The agent will respond to comments and messages, fostering community interaction.
# 4. **Performance Analysis**: It will analyze post performance and adjust strategies accordingly.
# 5. **Learning and Adaptation**: The agent will learn from user interactions and adapt its strategies over time.

# Authenticate to the X.com API
auth = tweepy.OAuth1UserHandler(API_KEY, api_secret, ACCESS_TOKEN, access_token_secret)
api = tweepy.API(auth)

# Set up logging
